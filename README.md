## Project Management

 * ### Trello
      I used an excellent application called [Trello](https://trello.com/en-GB) which greatly improved organisation and productivity. This tool allows the individual to properly plan and create a systematic work flow so you are always aware of what needs to be done next.

      I would first create a very basic overview of what I wanted to achieve and then break it down into smaller more manageable steps. Before finishing for the day, I would spend at least 15 minutes planning for the next day so that when I came back to developing I could open my Trello board and instantly get back developing since I would know immediately what I need to be working on. I highly recommend this tool to any developer or development team. <br /><br />

* ## Lighthouse Testing 

    * Furthermore the website has been through the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Microsoft Edge Dev Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/open/?tabs=cmd-Windows) Lighthouse Testing which tests the website for the following:
        * Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
        * Accessibility - Is the site accessible for all players and how can it be improved.
        * Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
        * SEO - Search Engine Optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

    * The lighthouse tests were conducted in incognito/private windows due to extensions interfering with the results.<br /><br />

    ### navigator.userAgent/appVersion and platform
    
    * When inspecting the website with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), the website is showing one issue which is the same issue I had on my Project Portfolio 1 and Project Portfolio 2 so I'm familiar with it.<br /><br />

    ![Site Issue](assets/images/readme-images/navigator-agent-issue-image.png)
    
    * I've done some research and apparently this is a Google Chrome issue as per this [source](https://forum.codewithmosh.com/t/the-ultimate-javascript-console-issue-at-beginning-of-course/6535) and has been reported [here](https://githubmemory.com/repo/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/issues/808). Additionally, I have tested this website with Microsoft Edge and the issue doesn't show.
